# Linux Scripts
Some foolish scripts just to explore my creativity and the commands of the Linux.

	- Each script bash file contains the script itself and the explanation of it commented, if you think it's better to create a README file, tell me please!

There's nothing more to explain :D

Help me with ideas, and even code, so that I can analyze and learn new resources and commands :)

Let's become better together!
